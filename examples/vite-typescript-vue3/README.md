# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

Example of using `vue-datocms` features in a project based on Vite.js and Vue 3 running on Typescript.

## To test locally

First follow the instructions on how to work locally on `vue-datocms`.

Then get to the example folder and run:

``` bash
$ npm run setup
```

This command builds and installs `vue-datocms` in the example pretty much as it would be done in producion: `vue-datocms` is packed and installed as a `.tgz` compressed tarball.

Then run:

``` bash
$ npm run dev
```

to have the example running.
