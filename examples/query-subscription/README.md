Example of using [datocms-listen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/datocms-listen) to implement real-time updates in a Vue.js v2 application.s

## To test locally

First follow the instructions on how to work locally on `vue-datocms`.

Then get to the example folder and run:

``` bash
$ npm run setup
```

This command builds and installs `vue-datocms` in the example pretty much as it would be done in producion: `vue-datocms` is packed and installed as a `.tgz` compressed tarball.

Then run:

``` bash
$ npm run serve
```

to have the example running.
