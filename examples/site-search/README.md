# Site search

Example of using `useSiteSearch` composable for implementing a full-text search using DatoCMS

## To test locally

First read [the instructions](/#development) on how to work locally on `vue-datocms`.

Then get to the example folder and run:

```bash
$ npm run setup
```

This command builds and installs `vue-datocms` in the example pretty much as it would be done in production: `vue-datocms` is packed and installed as a `.tgz` compressed tarball.

Then run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

to have the example running.
